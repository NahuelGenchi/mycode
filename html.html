                        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that
                            tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as
                            simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you
                            use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a
                            certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another
                            page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>

                            <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                            <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
                            <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
                            <li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
                            <li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
                            <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a
                                paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>HTML History</h2>
                        <p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially,
                            published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version
                            of HTML.</p>
                        <p>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</p>
                        <ul class="mainGlossary__ul--ulist">
                            <li><span class="highlightedWord">HTML 1.0</span> was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</li>
                            <li>Then comes the <span class="highlightedWord">HTML 2.0</span>, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features, which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</li>
                            <li>Then comes the <span class="highlightedWord">HTML 3.0</span>, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</li>
                            <li>Then comes <span class="highlightedWord">HTML 4.01</span>, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before <span class="highlightedWord">HTML 5.0</span>, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</li>
